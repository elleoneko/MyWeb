# **Farmer Wage Prediction Using Regression Model**

This study addresses the issue of wage inequality within the Philippine agricultural sector, focusing on the period from 2010 to 2019, a time marked by significant economic and policy changes. Employing a dual methodological approach, this research uses Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) and Random Forest (RF) to analyze real wage data of agricultural workers, considering variables such as gender, region, crop type, and year. The application
